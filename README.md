## What is Bingo?

**Bingo** is a web application which may be used by a community as a medium for exchanging services and goods within the community. This application will be modeled as [Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_exchange_trading_system "Wikipedia article for LETS"), which is a foundation used by communities to conduct transactions using their locally valid currencies.

**Bingo** is the successor of the [Let It Bee Project](http://code.google.com/p/swe574group2 "Google Code project page for Let It Bee") that is developed by [Bogazici University Software Engineering](http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/graduate/msInSwe " Official web page of the Master of Science in Software Engineering Program at Bogazici University") students for the "Software Development as a Team" course.

## Technical Details

The application is developed in [Java](http://www.java.com "Java") using the [Play! Framework](http://www.playframework.org "Play! Framework"). The [MySQL](http://mysql.com "MySQL") database server is used for managing application related data.

## Mockups

The first step we took was to analyze the predecessor project, find its weaknesses and fix them. During that process, we decided to update the graphical user interface. First thing was to create mockups and you can find them from this url: http://swe574group1.github.com/Bingo .

## Requirements Analysis

The requirements specification document of the project is written depending on the mockups. The document can be reached via https://github.com/swe574group1/Bingo/wiki/Requirements-Specification-Document .

## Implementation Plan

The project is developed by using the Iterative and Incremental Development methodology. Detailed project implementation plan can be found here: https://github.com/swe574group1/Bingo/blob/master/docs/plan/implementation_plan.pdf

### Setting up the development environment
