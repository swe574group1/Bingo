## What is Bingo?

**Bingo** is a web application which may be used by a community as a medium for exchanging services and goods within the community. This application will be modeled as [Local Exchange Trading Systems (LETS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_exchange_trading_system "Wikipedia article for LETS"), which is a foundation used by communities to conduct transactions using their locally valid currencies.

**Bingo** is the successor of the [Let It Bee Project](http://code.google.com/p/swe574group2 "Google Code project page for Let It Bee") that is developed by [Bogazici University Software Engineering](http://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/graduate/msInSwe " Official web page of the Master of Science in Software Engineering Program at Bogazici University") students for the "Software Development as a Team" course.
